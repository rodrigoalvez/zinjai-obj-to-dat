# Blender's .obj to .dat File Converter.
Small project developed using C++ and the ZinjaI IDE to convert Blenders's 3D models saved as .obj files to .dat files.

## How to use it
- 1. Execute obj-to-dat-converter.exe
- 2. Enter the name of the .obj file you want to convert, after putting it into the 'filesToConvert' folder, without the '.obj' extension.
- 3. If the process ends up successfully, your file will be stored in the 'createdDatFiles' folder.
